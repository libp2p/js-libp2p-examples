In libp2p terms a "private" node is one behind a [NAT firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation) that prevents it from being dialed externally.

This could be a browser, a node.js process or something else.

Nodes that support the [libp2p WebRTC transport](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/webrtc/webrtc.md) such as browsers can by dialed via this method even if they are behind a NAT.
